      <h1>About Game of Thrones </h1>
      <p>
        George R.R. Martin's best-selling book series "A Song of Ice and Fire"
        is brought to the screen as HBO sinks its considerable storytelling
        teeth into the medieval fantasy epic. It's the depiction of two powerful
        families -- kings and queens, knights and renegades, liars and honest
        men -- playing a deadly game for control of the Seven Kingdoms of
        Westeros, and to sit atop the Iron Throne.
