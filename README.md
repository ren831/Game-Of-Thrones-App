# Game of Thrones APP

With simplicity in mind, this App not only allows you to see the characters of Game of Thrones utilizing the [GOT API](https://thronesapi.com/). You can see their name(full, first, and last), their title and also which family they belong to. You can also add new characters as the characters grow with the addition of new seasons and spin offs.

You can visit the App here: [GOT-App]()
